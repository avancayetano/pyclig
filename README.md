# PyCLIG
PyCLIG is a Python micro-package for developing command-line interface (CLI) games.

Note: This package doesn't include event-listeners (yet), so it needs external library/module for that.
My example used Pynput for keyboard event-listeners.

# HOW TO USE:
Just clone this repo and copy the pyclig directory to your project, then import it.
I don't know how to publish this package and I'm too lazy to learn.
